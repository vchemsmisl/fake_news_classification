The purpose of this project is to create a classification algorithm, based on classical ML-models, using hand-made text features (such as number of words, sentences, different POS, named entity types, stylometric measures etc.) and FastText embeddings. There is also an exploration of texts' topics via topic modeling. 
The best model on English data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset/data?select=True.csv) â€“ SVM (accuracy = 0.98)
